<!-- 
Position : It is used to position an element in a specific way on the page
Types of position :(top , bottom , left , right) - it is used to specify the position of an element in relation to its normal position or to the viewport
1. static - normal flow of the document - it is the default position of all elements - it does not allow to use top , bottom , left , right properties
2.relative - initially normal flow of the document but it allows to use top , bottom , left , right properties - it is used to position an element relative to its normal position
top: 20px; // shift to bottom by 20px
left: 20px; // shift to right by 20px
3.absolute - element will remove from the document - it will give its position to other element  
4.fixed (doesnt move while scrolling)  - element will remove from the document - it will give its position to other element - it is used to position an element relative to the viewport - it will stay in the same position even if the page is scrolled
5.sticky- it is used to position an element based on the user's scroll position - it toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position of the user 
(like fixed but it will be fixed only when we scroll to that element- only particular element )
