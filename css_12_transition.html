            The transition-timing-function property in CSS controls the speed curve (also called easing) of a transition. It determines how the intermediate values between the starting and ending states are calculated over the transition's duration.

            In simple terms:
            It decides whether the transition moves at a constant speed, starts slow and speeds up, speeds up then slows down, or follows a custom acceleration pattern.
