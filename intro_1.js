what is javascript? 
javascript is a programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages. 
It is an essential part of web development, alongside HTML and CSS.
JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. It is a versatile
js is used to create dynamic content, control multimedia, animate images, and much more.
JavaScript is an interpreted language, meaning it is executed line by line at runtime, 
which allows for quick development and testing.
It can be used on both the client-side (in the browser) and server-side (with Node.js).
JavaScript supports object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles.
JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, untyped, and interpreted programming language.
JavaScript is often used in conjunction with HTML and CSS to create interactive web applications.
It is a prototype-based language, meaning it uses prototypes rather than classes for inheritance.
js can be used for both front-end and back-end development, making it a full-stack language.

key components of javascript:
1. scripting language : line by by line execution 
2. interpreted language : no need to compile or u mean no need to install a compiler , we can use browser console or serve for node.js
3. case sensitive 
4. object based language : everything is an object in js
5. single threaded : js runs in a single thread, meaning it can only execute one command at a time, but it can handle asynchronous operations.
6. allow aynchronous functions : js can handle asynchronous operations using callbacks, promises, and async/await in ES6
7. Event driven architecture: event handling is a key feature of JavaScript, allowing developers to create interactive applications that respond to user actions.



How to use js?
internal: using <script> tag in HTML where we write js code directly in between the tags.
external: using <script src="path_to_js_file.js"></script> tag in HTML to link an external JavaScript 
file where our js code is written.
inline: using the onclick attribute in HTML elements to execute JavaScript code when an event occur i.e event handling




PRINT STATEMENT
console.log("Hello, World!"); // This will print "Hello, World!" to the console
document.write("Hello, World!"); // This will write "Hello, World!" to the HTML document
alert("Hello, World!"); // This will show an alert box with "Hello, World!" , this is a pop up message



DATA-TYPES in JS:
i) Prementive Data Types: number(12,1.2), string(alphabet,alphanumeric,character | '',""), 
boolean(true,false), undefined(when we declared variable but didn't assign any value), null
ii) Complex Data Types: array, object, JSON(Javascript Object Notation) – object

How to check datatypes?
typeof – keyword
