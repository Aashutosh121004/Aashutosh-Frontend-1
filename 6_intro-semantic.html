    <!-- in html tage semantic- it clearly describes their meaning to both the browser and the developer
    semantic tag is basically used for the search engine optimization(SEO)- that is what file of content is inside the tag
    semantic tags are used to define the different parts of a web page

    why use semantic tags?
    easy to understand and maintain
    great for seo
    and clean readers

    common semantic tag 
    1.header - represents the top section of a page- usually includes logos , navigation links or heading
    2.nav- define a section with navigation 
    3.main - represents the main content of a document
    must be only one main tag in a document
    4.section - groups content into sections - sections can be multiple
    5.article - represents a self-contained piece of content - like a blog post or news article
    6.aside - defines content that is tangentially related to the main content- like sidebars, ads or related links
    7.footer - represents the bottom section of a page- usually includes copyright info, contact details or links to related documents 
    
    
    non semantic tag (before html 5)
    1.div - div is a container element that is used to group other elements together- it does not provide any meaning about the content inside it
    2.span - span is an inline container element that is used to group text or other inline elements- it also does not provide any meaning about the content inside it
